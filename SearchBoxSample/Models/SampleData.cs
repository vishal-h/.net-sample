Cloud computing systems typically use REST-based APIs."},

Pricing on a utility computing basis is fine-grained with usage-based options and fewer IT skills are required for implementation (in-house).The e-FISCAL project's state of the art repository contains several articles looking into cost aspects in more detail, most of them concluding that costs savings depend on the type of activities supported and the type of infrastructure available in-house."},

As infrastructure is off-site (typically provided by a third-party) and accessed via the Internet, users can connect from anywhere."},

In addition, user access to security audit logs may be difficult or impossible. Private cloud installations are in part motivated by users' desire to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control of information security."},
